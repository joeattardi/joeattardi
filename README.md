### Hi there 👋 👨‍💻

Hi, I'm Joe Attardi! I'm a full stack developer with a front-end focus. I really enjoy front-end development.
I've been building software professionally for over 15 years and I've loved every minute of it!

Currently, I work at Salesforce. In the past I've worked with companies such as Constant Contact, Dell, Nortel, and Sun Microsystems.

I've pinned some of my more popular repositories to my GitHub profile. Please feel free to check them out!

I live in the Boston area with my wife, son, and cats.
