### Hi there üëã üë®‚Äçüíª

Hi, I'm Joe Attardi! I'm a developer with a front-end focus. I really enjoy front-end development.
I've been building software professionally for over 15 years and I've loved every minute of it!

Currently, I work at Synopsys. In the past I've worked with companies such as Salesforce, Constant Contact, Dell, Nortel, and Sun Microsystems.

I'm also the author of two books from Apress: 

- [Modern CSS](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484262931)
- [Using Gatsby and Netlify CMS](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484262962)

I've pinned some of my more popular repositories to my GitHub profile. Please feel free to check them out!

I live in the Boston area with my wife, son, and cats.
